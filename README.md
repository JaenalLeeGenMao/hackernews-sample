## Introduction
I choose Nextjs because it is well documented, hackernews is a news platform which typically required SEO which Nextjs provided and I can kickstart the project immediate with minimum efforts. Technology that I choosed was react the learning curve was legitimate for most users, docker so I can deployed into multiple nodes on CI, storybook perfect for visualizing existing components. I only did the homepage because I am really busy at my work thats about it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

To explore existing components:
```bash
npm run storybook
# or
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
